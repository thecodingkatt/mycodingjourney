    <h2>How I'm Learning to Code</h2>
      <p>Starting this journey I was already familar with code and had a fair amount of experience writing short snippets and making modifications to existing code so I opted to use <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a> as I did not want to pay for a program that spent a lot of time covering the concepts I already know, and this is a completly free option and the format works really well for me. If you are completly new to coding though this format might not be what you're looking for, so I would suggest checking out <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/?utm_id=t_kwd-78958985904710:loc-4081:ag_1263339270701571:cp_370028884:n_o:d_c&msclkid=578bb6762ea312b1e255d1abc0afe7d9&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=US_Brand_Exact&utm_term=codecademy&utm_content=Codecademy">Code Cademy</a> there is a really great community there to help you get started and they have both free and paid courses you can choose from.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I can't wait to share everything I'm learning and watch my skills evolve.<p>
<h3><strong>Happy Coding!</strong></h3>
