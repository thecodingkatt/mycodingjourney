    <h2>How I'm Learning to Code</h2>
      <p>Starting this journey, I was already familiar with code and had a fair amount of experience writing short snippets and making modifications to existing code so I opted to use <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a> as I did not want to pay for a program that spent a lot of time covering the concepts I already know, and this is a free option. The format works well for me. If you are completely new to coding though, this format might not be what you're looking for, so I would suggest checking out <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/?utm_id=t_kwd-78958985904710:loc-4081:ag_1263339270701571:cp_370028884:n_o:d_c&msclkid=578bb6762ea312b1e255d1abc0afe7d9&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=US_Brand_Exact&utm_term=codecademy&utm_content=Codecademy">Code Cademy</a> there is a great community there to help you get started and they have both free and paid courses you can choose from.</p>

<h2>How Much Time I'm Spending</h2>
    <p>Since I'm already familiar with coding and want to go more in-depth on the projects, I'm spending about 30 minutes - 1 hour per session, 5 or 6 days per week. I find this schedule keeps me moving forward, minimizes mental fatigue, and is easy for me to manage. When I first started learning code, it was easy for me to get hyper-focused and spend several hours learning and practicing, but I quickly found the first hour was all that stuck long-term, so if you're starting your journey, don't fall into the same trap. Learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint, so pace yourself by keeping your sessions about 25 minutes at first, and increase the length of your sessions as you get comfortable; this will make your sessions more effective in the long run. </p>

    <p>I can't wait to share everything I'm learning and watch my skills evolve.<p>
<h3><strong>Happy Coding!</strong></h3>
